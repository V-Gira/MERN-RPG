# MERN-RPG

This uses the [mern-classroom](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-React-Projects-Second-Edition/tree/master/Chapter06/mern-classroom) project from the book *Full Stack React projects 2nd edition* by Pakt Publishing as a base.

The aim is to create a simple cooperative role-playing-game that can be played directly in the browser, without requiring any knowledge of the system to start a game.

### Basic Features:

- A game master can create a game for other players to join.
- Players can join a game and create a character sheet.
- A simple chat client allows all players within a game to communicate.
- The game master can prompt players to act within the game.
- Players can interact with their character sheet to act within the game.

### Advanced Features:
- A tool generates choices to help the game master create an adventure.
- Discord integration (OAuth2 log in)
